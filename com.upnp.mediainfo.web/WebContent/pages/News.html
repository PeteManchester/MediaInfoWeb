			1986-90: Appearance, tabloids, Bad, films, autobiography, and
			Neverland: See also: Michael Jackson's health and appearance
			Jackson's skin had been a medium-brown color for the entire duration
			of his youth, but starting in the mid-1980s, it gradually grew paler.
			The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors that he
			might be bleaching his skin. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli's
			biography, in 1986, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo and lupus;
			the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in
			remission; both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight. The
			treatments he used for his condition further lightened his skin tone,
			and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches, he
			could appear very pale. Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in
			his autopsy. By the mid-1990s several surgeons speculated that he had
			undergone various nasal surgeries, a forehead lift, thinned lips, and
			cheekbone surgery--although Jackson denied this and insisted that he
			only had surgery on his nose. Jackson claimed that he had only two
			rhinoplasties and no other surgery on his face, although at one point
			he mentioned having a dimple created in his chin. Jackson lost weight
			in the early 1980s because of a change in diet and a desire for "a
			dancer's body". Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy and
			speculated that he was suffering from anorexia nervosa; periods of
			weight loss would become a recurring problem later in life. During
			the course of his treatment, Jackson made two close friends: his
			dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein, and Klein's nurse Debbie Rowe. Rowe
			eventually became Jackson's second wife and the mother of his two
			eldest children. He also relied heavily on Klein for medical and
			business advice. Jackson became the subject of increasingly
			sensational reports. In 1986, the tabloids ran a story claiming that
			Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging
			process; he was pictured lying down in a glass box. Although the
			claim was untrue, according to tabloid reports that are widely cited,
			Jackson had disseminated the fabricated story himself. When Jackson
			bought a chimpanzee called Bubbles from a laboratory, he was reported
			to be increasingly detached from reality. It was reported that
			Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick (the "elephant
			man") and although untrue, Jackson did not deny the story. Although
			initially he saw these stories as opportunities for publicity, he
			stopped leaking untruths to the press as they became more
			sensational. Consequently the media began making up their own
			stories. These reports became embedded in the public consciousness,
			inspiring the nickname "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson came to despise.
			Responding to the gossip, Jackson remarked to Taraborrelli: <br>
